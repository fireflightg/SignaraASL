### About the Project

Signara is a web application that uses AI and machine learning to recognize and confirm ASL signs in real-time. Working closely with Ohio School for the Deaf and other organizations, Signara provides structured lessons and exercises that help users master sign language at their own pace.

Our mission is to make ASL learning accessible and free, offering an alternative to expensive sign language classes and reducing the barrier to entry for those interested in learning ASL.
